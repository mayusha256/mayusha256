# Hi there! <img src="assets/02_cheer.gif" alt="02" style="width:24px; height:24px;" />

## Little about me 

Full-stack developer (frontend & backend).

Primary languages: Go and TypeScript. I'm a little dumb for Rust. ![02](assets/typingcat.gif)

I run local LLMs with llama.cpp and use function-calling + RAG.

About DevOps... Basic knowledge — Linux, Docker, and all... 

About GameDev... Godot is my god! (pls give me money for development)

## Fun facts

I have reinstalled my OS ~500+ times over the last few years (estimate: about once a week).

I play Minecraft.

I'm not a fan of Plasma/GNOME or Wayland — I prefer X11 workflows.
